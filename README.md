App Description:  Geocast is a user-friendly website that allows you to discover real-time weather information anywhere in the world. By simply inputing a location the Geocoding API will provide precise latitude and longitude coordinates, enabling the Weather API to deliver accurate and up-to-date weather forecasts for your chosen area.


API links - 
- Open Weather (https://rapidapi.com/worldapi/api/open-weather13/)
- Google Maps Geocoding (https://rapidapi.com/googlecloud/api/google-maps-geocoding/)


IDEA: Basically weather app, the user inputs a location and then the Geocoding API spits out a long and lat based on that and then based on that info the Weather API gives info about the weather in that area
